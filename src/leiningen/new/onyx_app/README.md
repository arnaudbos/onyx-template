# {{app-name}}

An Onyx 0.8.3 application that does distributed things. This project has been populated with a sample job and some basic Onyx idioms to make development easier to use.

## Usage

### Development
During development, you can use the `(with-test-env)` macro to start and stop
Onyx environments on your local machine. You should use the same macro for your
development as well as automated testing.

There are four main parts of the dev/test environment.


1. The `let` binding sets up a dev-mode configuration. This is a plain clojure
map describing [peer-config](http://www.onyxplatform.org/cheat-sheet.html#/peer-config)
and [environment-config](http://www.onyxplatform.org/cheat-sheet.html#/env-config). Any of these
defaults can be overriden. The 0-arity version of load-config loads the default
map suitable for development.

    ```
    (let [id (java.util.UUID/randomUUID)
          config (load-config)
          env-config (assoc (:env-config config) :onyx/id id)
          peer-config (assoc (:peer-config config) :onyx/id id)]
    ```
2. The `(with-test-env)` macro will setup and teardown a full fledged
test environment for running your job (or jobs) locally. It handles the
different failure conditions of Onyx, as well as terminating when it
recieves an interupt (Ctrl-C). The macro is [*anaphoric*](http://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap6.html)
,meaning that it creates a development environment and binds it to a
user defined symbol. In this case, that symbol is `test-env`.

    ```
    (with-test-env [test-env [5 env-config peer-config]]
    ```

3. `(build-job :dev)` is a convinient idiom we use to build onyx jobs. Most of
the time, you're going to be testing your workflows on a static dataset during
development time, but switch to a SQL DB or a Kafka queue when in production. We
signal this switch with a `mode` keyword. This keyword is then used to build
and modify the job map. In this case, switching from `:dev` to `:prod` switches
out the stock input (reading lines from a file) and output (core.async channel)
in favor of using a Kafka queue and a MySQL db for reading and writing.

4. The rest of the inner body of `with-test-env` is devoted entirely to
submitting the job and collecting the results. We provide the function
`(get-core-async-channels)` to return a map of channels allocated at the start
of the job, in this case it's only one that we care about, `:write-lines`.
That will have an associated channel that we can use to collect our output!

Try to run the test, and watch the output of onyx.log in your project root.

# Onyx Application Template

A Leiningen template for creating Onyx apps.

### Usage

To get an application template with a sample job:

```text
lein new onyx-app my-app-name
```
Then read the instructions on the `README.md` in your fresh project.

### Options
The template also supports the following options

```
lein new onyx-app my-app-name -- +docker
```

`+docker` adds a containerized onyx example that will stream meetup.com data
through a single node kafka cluster, a simple onyx workflow, and write to a
MySQL databse.

```
lein new onyx-app my-app-name -- +metrics
```
For adding the ability to instrument any step in a workflow with latency and
throughput metrics. It is highly recommended that this option is applied.
